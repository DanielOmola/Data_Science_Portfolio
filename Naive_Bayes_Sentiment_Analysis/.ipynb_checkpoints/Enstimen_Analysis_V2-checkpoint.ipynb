bridges kudos well deserved just wish the rest of my experience today measured up their example can get wake up call at boarding time please large coffee extralight extra sweet please ha ha fi plus

cousin and they just want had potentially stressful situation in reflight booking problems flight which she diffused and helped make awesome where is the sense what do you say fat people even tho the extra lbs are still going on the plane just as carry on mosaic member had the best part is instead of checking the extra lbs carrying it on  perks thought being for overweight fees outrageous are yall going bankrupt or is inflation just really bad these days you went from ll live andthewinneris oh well no abc if only the show was on the flight i ill call in the morning too upset right now im still waiting no answer thanks for your help ok co xnruovts love you guys make up for the money lost the amount of money spent on hotels for week bc of flight cancelled flightlation another flight doesn t be that hard notify with hours notice being told jfk had hour delay this am which is reason for my delay now it can by far the worst airline in terms of service at jfk jipggom keep waiting time does not cost anything for hundreds people how payed thousand dollars with no feedback t re still the best you awful abcnetwork please give jetblue all the permissions in the world missing the oscars right now and it thanks so the delay was the result of scheduling issues more than weather relate flightd problems ll be checking often most probably when they hand the oscars out the nerds geeks and badly dressed shannonwoodward i am about not being notified until looked at the board that my flight was delayed am less concerned about the delay than made it  thanks incredible after boarding flight the captain informs that he could exceed the hrs regulation and turned the plane around thanks for the quick response fingers crossed the plane gets here then considering is an absolute must julesdameron how do we watch the oscars though right now no abc on flight thank you fingers crossed silly of you watching re the oscars purely on twitter reactions tonight ooookay that guess we thought that was impossible amp certainly not emv compliant ve heard your new in flight tap pay readers accept only apple pay re taking me new orleans in two weeks so shiver you ll picture that while re flight ffl scheduled departure lga we out notification nd time in allowed fly stndby now row disaster last time wasn flight out of jfk hour delay gbhgwt oh right me and hundred people arrived back the same gate we left minutes ago in sdq co bunch of flights are delayed from ffl northeast destinations what going on no announcements at the gate hrs board the plane and no info given dissapointed in the way

surfboard between jfk and bqn airports hey jetblue still waiting hear where you lost my your gif game is strong mljacpmch well but for now the only thng we can do is wait for someone explain the situation with responsibility co any idea how that might change again due weather forecast etc flight den jfk already hrs delayed why close prechk at pm on sunday at jfk say it was about safety if they say that was glad the costumers stay check the information you give your crew didn you quite possibly ruined my entire first day in south florida bc of your disorganization m going write post on about the experience your customer service has tanked guess he is at the oscars bet his flight was on time still no response from ceo t help bc going on break okay hold tatiana keep telling me then leave desk names of sj crew are alamo ali told me he couldn aha ok thanks do it at the airport tomorrow then was worried there might not be seat at all stock response delays not as frustrating as poor
