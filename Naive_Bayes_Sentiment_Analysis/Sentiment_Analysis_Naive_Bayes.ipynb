at   thank you  hopefully it  thank you awesome  just your internal testing and training is currently apple pay specific  okay so anything using contactless emv should work  we should get better than this hard when you re with your younger siblings and cousin and they just want on the airplane potentially stressful situation in reflight booking problems  had flight which she diffused and helped make awesome carry on  where is the sense  what do you say fat people  even tho the extra lbs are still going on the plane  just as m carrying it on  perks thought being mosaic member had   the best part is instead of checking the extra lbs    for overweight fees  outrageous are yall going bankrupt or is inflation just really bad these days  you went from   ll live  no abc    oh well andthewinneris if only the show was on the flight   too upset right now ill call in the morning    no answer  im still waiting   thanks for your help ok co love you guys     xnruovts t make up for the money lost  the amount of money spent on hotels for week bc of flight cancelled flightlation  another flight doesn hour delay this am which is reason for my delay now  it can be that hard notify with hours notice being told jfk had  by far the worst airline in terms of service at jfk  co jipggom  keep waiting  time does not cost anything for hundreds people how payed thousand dollars with no feedback   you re still the best missing the oscars right now  and it  abcnetwork please give jetblue all the permissions in the world  awful  thanks  so the delay was the result of scheduling issues more than weather relate flightd problems   shannonwoodward ll be checking often  most probably when they hand the oscars out the nerds  geeks and badly dressed i am less concerned about the delay than looked at the board that my flight was delayed am about not being notified until thanks  made it   incredible  after boarding flight   the captain informs that he could exceed the hrs regulation and turned the plane around thanks for the quick response  fingers crossed the plane gets here then   is an absolute must   julesdameron  considering   how do we watch the oscars though right now   no abc on flight   thank you  fingers crossed silly of you  guess we watching  the oscars purely on twitter reactions tonight  ooookay that re  thought that was impossible  ve heard your new in flight
